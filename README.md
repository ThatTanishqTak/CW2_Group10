1. Realtime Financial Forecasting
In this topic, the objective is to develop a deep learning based system for real-time 
financial applications, with a specific focus on timeseries forecasting. The goal is to 
predict one of the following:
• The exchange rate of a currency pair found in the foreign exchange market
• The stock price of a major corporation 
• The value of a cryptocurrency
These financial datasets are sourced from the historical data provided by NASDAQ and 
are discussed in further detail below. You are required to choose one of these three
datasets based on your interests to proceed with the assignment. 
a) Load the data sets from the zipped csv files via the link below and verify no 
records are missing.

b)Starbucks Stock Prices:
Stock exchanges, such as the NASDAQ (an electronic exchange), are markets 
where stocks of a company are traded. Stocks are generally issued by 
corporations to raise capital; the purchase of which gives ownership of a 
proportion of the corporation's shares. Starbucks stock has seen large 
fluctuations in the past five years. The dataset contains the Starbucks daily open 
price in the range of dates between 13/11/2017-10/01/2025, with1800 samples.

c) Visualise the datasets and perform any necessary pre-processing.
d) Treat the problem as a time series forecasting task, ensuring the data is 
appropriately divided into training, validation, and testing sets based on your 
chosen approach.

e) Build and train multiple deep learning models using Keras. It is recommended
to develop (1) one model that processes the data independently at each time 
instance, (2) two models that considers them as a timeseries, (3) one deep 
network, to approach the task as a regression problem. This will result in a total 
of 4 separate models.
f) Evaluate the performance of the models on the test dataset and report the results 
in a comparative study (example metrics: MAE, MAPE, R^2, MSE, etc.)

Group Report – [6-8 pages text and results (more pages if we include images/code parts/ 
references)]
The Group Project Report should include:
• Aims and Objectives of your theme problem
• Analysis of the existing DNNs
• Analysis of the designed DNNs
• Analysis of the training process
• Comparative analysis and performance evaluation of all the DNNs used
• References (e.g. IEEE, Harvard, etc.).
Individual Report – Conclusions and Self-evaluation [max 1 page]
• Conclusions should include a short analysis of your own contribution (maximum a 
paragraph 10 lines) and a reflection on your work and the expected outcomes 
(maximum a paragraph 10 lines).
• Use the template in APPENDIX I to assess both the group submission and your own 
individual submission, as well as to rate the contributions of the group members 
towards the group submission.
Learning outcomes being assessed
• Select and specify suitable methods and algorithms relevant for a particular data 
analysis process;
• Build machine learning and artificial intelligence systems using software packages 
and/or specialised libraries;
• Articulate and demonstrate the specific problems associated with different phases or 
tasks of a machine learning or artificial intelligence pipeline;
• Assess and evaluate machine learning methods using datasets and appropriate criteria;
• Develop advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions for 
applications such as video and image analysis, information security, and data science.
Marking Scheme (50%) [30% software and 15% the report + 5%video]
Following items will be concerned in the process of marking:
• Completed parts (15%)
• Code quality (5%)
• Effort/Complexity –what technical skills have been demonstrated (5%)
• Application quality – Highlights (5%)
• Quality of documentation (15%)
• Quality of video (5%)

Deliverables
[A] Canvas: Online submission of the individual report using Canvas. This is an individual 
submission with the Individual Report including the Conclusions and the Self-Evaluation 
(see APPENDIX I). 
This report is not marked, but it helps to understand the contributions of each student in 
the group report and application. If it is not submitted, then we will assume that the
student didn’t contribute to the project.
[B] OneDrive Submission Instruction: The project should be sent using the OneDrive folder.
For each team, please ensure that ONLY the group leader per group will be invited to 
submit a zipped copy of your group work. This submission should include a copy of your 
group report, the running codes, and a demo video via a designated group report submission 
portal. Each group leader will receive access to this portal via an email invitation, which will 
provide access solely for uploading purposes. Please ensure that the submitted zip file is named 
using your group name (e.g. CI7521_CW2_Group01).
The project folder should contain:
• Runnable program of your solution accompanied with all the files required to 
run.
• All the datasets that are required to train and deploy the DNNs
• All the pre-trained models (both the ones found online and the ones the students 
trained)
• A copy of the group report
• A video demonstrating the application (no more than 250MB)
